            I am a team driven person, that always puts the growth of everyone
            as the number one priority. I am fascinated by the fast pace
            technology brought us humans many steps forward. I am a curious
            person with a continuos improvement mindset. Challenges are what
            really get the best out of me, but i believe that competition only
            exists outside of the company.

            I made my first steps as a software engineer in Austria in one of
            the best technology campus in Europe. After working full time for a
            leading E-Learning provider, Click&Learn, I took some time to travel
            South America in order to broaden my horizon.

            industry.
